Moreover, the proliferation and adoption of social media applications have provided extensive opportunities and challenges for researchers and practitioners. The massive amount of data generated by users using social media platforms is the result of the integration of their background details and daily activities. This enormous volume of generated data known as “big data” has been intensively researched recently. A review of the recent works is presented to obtain a broad perspective of the social media big data analytics research topic. We classify the literature based on important aspects. This study also compares possible big data analytics techniques and their quality attributes. Moreover, we provide a discussion on the applications of social media big data analytics by highlighting the state-of-the-art techniques, methods, and the quality attributes of various studies. Open research challenges in big data analytics are described as well.}

Many researchers have worked for sustainable development goals using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to develop an efficient mechanism to facilitate a circular economy and link up the needs of the present generation without disconcerting the capability of coming generations. This study offers a comprehensive review of AI and sustainability and suggested future research scope. The review has focused on different use cases in industries like construction, transportation, healthcare, manufacturing, agriculture, and water. The systematic review is based on 287 papers selected out of 8341 search results with an application of PRISMA based method. Out of all the techniques used in sustainability regression, RL and DSS-based AI models are more popular than others. The review also provides directions surrounding which industrial sectors are using which methods for incorporating sustainable development practices in their organization.}

A total of 100 papers including 63 empirical papers (74 studies) and 37 analytic papers were selected from the education and educational research category of Social Sciences Citation Index database from 2010 to 2020. The content analysis showed that the research questions could be classified into development layer (classification, matching, recommendation, and deep learning), application layer (feedback, reasoning, and adaptive learning), and integration layer (affection computing, role-playing, immersive learning, and gamification). Moreover, four research trends, including Internet of Things, swarm intelligence, deep learning, and neuroscience, as well as an assessment of AI in education, were suggested for further investigation. However, we also proposed the challenges in education may be caused by AI with regard to inappropriate use of AI techniques, changing roles of teachers and students, as well as social and ethical issues. The results provide insights into an overview of the AI used for education domain, which helps to strengthen the theoretical foundation of AI in education and provides a promising channel for educators and AI engineers to carry out further collaborative research.}

abstract = {The effective management of water resources is essential to environmental stewardship and sustainable development. Traditional approaches to water resource management (WRM) struggle with real-time data acquisition, effective data analysis, and intelligent decision-making. To address these challenges, innovative solutions are required. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data Analytics (BDA) are at the forefront and have the potential to revolutionize the way water resources are managed. This paper reviews the current applications of AI and BDA in WRM, highlighting their capacity to overcome existing limitations. It includes the investigation of AI technologies, such as machine learning and deep learning, and their diverse applications to water quality monitoring, water allocation, and water demand forecasting. In addition, the review explores the role of BDA in the management of water resources, elaborating on the various data sources that can be used, such as remote sensing, IoT devices, and social media. In conclusion, the study synthesizes key insights and outlines prospective directions for leveraging AI and BDA for optimal water resource allocation.}

Data on research production collected on 2 top-tiers AIED conferences indicate that relatively similar imbalances exist in AIED. Potential threats and challenges induced by that situation are discussed as well as additionally identified phenomena related to the culture of the AIED community.}

Two classroom studies examined whether Teachable Agents (TA) achieves this goal. TA is an instructional technology that draws on the social metaphor of teaching a computer agent to help students learn. Students teach their agent by creating concept maps. Artificial intelligence enables TA to use the concept maps to answer questions, thereby providing interactivity, a model of thinking, and feedback. Elementary schoolchildren learning science with TA exhibited “added-value” learning that did not adversely affect the “basic-value” they gained from their regular curriculum, despite trade-offs in instructional time. Moreover, TA prepared students to learn new science content from their regular lessons, even when they were no longer using the software.}
